NAME
    Kliq - KLIQ Mobile REST API

VERSION
    0.001

WARNING
    Developer Preview, does not do much yet.

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use Kliq;
        dance;

DESCRIPTION
    Kliq is the tranzmt.it REST API implementation built on top of Redis
    and the Dancer framework.

    All submissions are welcome.

  Routes
    GET /
        Redirects to <http://developers.tranzmt.it>.

INSTALLATION
    You must first install the dependencies:

        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test

    Kliq uses a MySQL database called "kliq2". Create this database first:

        CREATE DATABASE kliq2;
        USE kliq2;
        GRANT ALL ON kliq2.* TO 'kliq_SSM'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'self-expression';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    Then create the tables using:

        $ perl bin/kliq_spawndb.pl -deploy

    You can also easily create the database schema with kliq_spawndb.pl, run
    it without options to see the documentation. Also, make sure you have
    Redis running. Then, run the Plack server on localhost, port 5000:

    You can also run the Dancer development server at port 3004, but the
    routes will be different:

        $ perl bin/kliq.pl

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration can be achieved via the config.yml file or via the "set"
    keyword. To use the config.yml approach, you will need to install YAML.
    See the Dancer documentation for more information.

    You can alternatively configure the server via the "set" keyword in the
    source code. This approach does not require a config file.

        use Dancer;
        use Kliq;

        # Dancer specific config settings
        set logger      => 'file';
        set log         => 'debug';
        set show_errors => 1;

        dance;

DEPLOYMENT
    Deployment is very flexible. It can be run on a web server via CGI or
    FastCGI. It can also be run on any Plack web server. See
    Dancer::Deployment for more details.

  FastCGI
    Kliq can be run via FastCGI. This requires that you have the FCGI and
    Plack modules installed. Here is an example FastCGI script. It assumes
    your KLIQ server is in the file kliq.pl.

        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Dancer ':syntax';
        use Plack::Handler::FCGI;

        my $app = do "/path/to/kliq.pl";
        my $server = Plack::Handler::FCGI->new(nproc => 5, detach => 1);
        $server->run($app);

    Here is an example lighttpd config. It assumes you named the above file
    kliq.fcgi.

        fastcgi.server += (
            "/" => ((
                "socket" => "/tmp/fcgi.sock",
                "check-local" => "disable",
                "bin-path" => "/path/to/kliq.fcgi",
            )),
        )

    Now Kliq will be running via FastCGI under /.

  Plack
    Kliq can be run with any Plack web server. Just run:

        $ plackup bin/kliq.pl

    You can change the Plack web server via the -s option to plackup.
